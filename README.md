# winfiles

winfiles is a silly name, but is analogous to the dotfiles repo.

Just beginning to make an effort to have some reproducible Windows settings for
the desktop.

For now we only remap Caps Lock to Left Ctrl.

In the future, some basic things would go a long way, like editor settings,
installation of the editor, various toolchains, etc.

setup.bat should be run in administrator mode.

Uses scanmapset.exe from http://www.benf.org/other/scanmapset/index.html
Ultimately, scanmapset should probably be replaced with an explicit call to the
registry which is all it does.
